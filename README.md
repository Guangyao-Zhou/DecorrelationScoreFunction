# Decorrelation-Score Function Tutorial
The "Decorrelation-Score Function" implements a simulation function that performs some applications for Decorrelation-Score Function, which performs the Decorrelation-Score Function introduced by Ning, Liu, et al. (2017a) and Ning, Liu, et al. (2017b). This implementation can replicate some simple regression methods with decorrelation-Score Function.

## Introdcution
In this study, I focus on sparse high dimensional modeling with the general decorrelated score methods proposed in Ning, Liu, et al. (2017a) and explores to which extend does this general theory applies in regression models. A research question arises about the applicability and generalization of decorrelated score methods for interest models and other available regression models. Linear regression, logistic regression, and Poisson regresion are used to explore this question.
## Results Display 
Here are some replication simulation results of the power with linear regression, logistic regression, and Poisson regression:
