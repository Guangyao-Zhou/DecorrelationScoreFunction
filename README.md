# Decorrelation-Score Function Tutorial
The "Decorrelation-Score Function" implements a simulation function that performs some applications for Decorrelation-Score Function, which performs the Decorrelation-Score Function introduced by Ning, Liu, et al. (2017a) and Ning, Liu, et al. (2017b). This implementation can replicate some simple regression methods with decorrelation-Score Function.
